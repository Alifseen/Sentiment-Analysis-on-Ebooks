# Regex and Natural Language Processing

I learned the basic syntax of Regex and applied it to extract data from a book.

In the jupyter notebooks:
- I extracted all sentences containing a word. 
- I created a dictionary for occurrences of all words. 
- Split chapters
- Performed sentiment analysis on each chapter using NLTK

I also created a streamlit application that plots the contents of a diary's sentiments on chart.
